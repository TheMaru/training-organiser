## Database migrations

Database migrations are handled via [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)

```sh
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

Migration files are located in folder sql/schema

To migrate to the newest state you can use

```sh
goose postgres postgres://<user>:<host>:<port>/<db-name> up

```

## Database code

Code that interacts directly with the database is generated by [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/).

You can generate the code via

```sh
sqlc generate
```

## Env file

Before starting please copy ./.env.example and enter local env settings

```sh
cp ./.env.example ./.env
```
